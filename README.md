Since many industry equipments are designed to be on most of the time, it is useful for a monitoring device to be able to automatically identify if and when the machine has undergone malfunction, power outage or a turning off event.
In this work I use a reconstruction convolutional autoencoder model build with TensorFlow Keras to detect turning off events on data files produced by accelerometers attached to a compressor.
Please refer to the Jupyter Notebook for further explanations, code and results.
